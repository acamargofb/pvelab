
The structure of the camera parameter definition file: ( .def )


The file is a simple text file, with extension def.

The simulator reads only those one lines, which includes the = symbol. All other lines are comments.


General camera parameters: ( Sample data of the GE4096 PET scanner )


FOV=550			: The field of view of the scanner, in millimeter

members=96		: The number of projections in the x direction ( see radon transform, e.g. Matlab Help, or PhD thesis of Peter Toft )

theta=[270:-180/511:90]	: The projection angles in degrees and Matlab format

projectionOffset=0	: The start of the first projection line, in degree

calibrationFactor=2.8e5	: The camera acquisitoion efficiency with GE68 line source

voxelSize=0.048		: The volume of one voxel in ml.

pixelSize=2		: The size of one pixel on the transaxial slice (in millimeter)

radialResolutionValues=6 6.5 7	: The FWHM of a line source on the transaxial slice by different radius ( in millimeter ), 
radialResolutionRadius=0 100 200 :  and the corresponded radius values ( in millimeter )

axialPixelSize=6.5	: The width of the axial slices ( in millimeter )

axialResolutionValues=6 6.5 7	: The FWHM of a line source along the Z axis of the camera by different Z values ( in millimeter ), 
axialResolutionRadius=0 100 200	: and the corresponded Z values ( in millimeter )


Random effect parameters:
The random effect is described by the out = in / randomEffectConstant term and 
the random correction is described by the out = randomCorrectionConstants(1)*in^2 + randomCorrectionConstants(2)*in equation.

randomEffectConstant=1.0014

randomCorrectionConstants=0.0375 0.161


Scatter parameters: ( To measure these parameters on your camera, see H.Hoverath: Scatter correction in the transaxial 
		      slices of a whole-body positron emission tomograph. Phys. Med. Biol. 38(1993) 717-728.
